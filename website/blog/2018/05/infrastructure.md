## What is good password advice?

It was World Password Day this month. What, you didn’t know! It’s always the first Thursday in May.

Anyway, with it comes the floods of advice on social media as some companies seek a PR opportunity. The most common tweet/post being ‘A reminder to change your password frequently’. But this, as lots of people quickly pointed out, is terrible advice.

But hang on a second: isn't that the correct advice? Weren't all sysadmins basically forced to change their systems to make people reset passwords every few months because it was better for security? Yes, but that was way back in 2014. Starting late 2015, there was a big push from government departments across the world to not do that. Their reasoning is because this tends to nudge people toward using simpler passwords, and don't really make it harder for some Russian using a brute force attack to guess the password.

So what is my advice?

## Random or pronounceable?

Everyone agrees that using the word "password" for a password is pretty much the dumbest thing you can do. But so many people still do it that organisations have been forced to hardcode a ban on the word into most password systems. But from there – where do you go? How much better is "password1"? Is it sufficiently better? What about switching letters to other things, like "p@ssw0rd"? Yes, objectively, that is better. But the point is that there are much better ways. And that comes down to basically two choices: random or pronounceable.

The best random password is one that really is random i.e. not a weird spelling that you quickly forget but a combination of letters, numbers and symbols like "4&bqJv8dZrXgp" that you would simply never be able to remember. 

But here's the thing – the reason that particular password is better is largely because in order to use and generate such passwords, you would likely use a password manager. If someone is trying to crack your password randomly they are likely to be using automated software that simply fires thousands of possible passwords at a system until it hits the right one. In that scenario, it is not the gibberish that is important but the length of the password that matters. Computers don't care if a password is made up of English words - or words of any language. But the longer it is, the more guesses will be needed to get it right.

Of course, a big part of that assumption is that there will be lots of people that will introduce numbers and symbols and uppercase letters into their password. Without them, password-cracking software would limit itself to lowercase letters and so find the correct login much faster. Because length can be a critical factor, and because typing random letters and numbers is much more taxing for people, there are lots of people and organizations that argue that people should come up with passwords that comprise several random words that you can actually remember. There is merit to this argument and Google has been pushing the approach for a number of years. So which is better?

The answer is: both and neither. The pronounceable words approach is better if you want to remember the password and type it in. But it would be undermined if huge numbers of people weren't also using numbers and symbols in their passwords. Plus of course there is the reality that many organisations institute strict password policies when you sign up with them that often require you to have an uppercase letter, a number and/or a symbol. In these cases, your pronounceable-words password won’t actually work.

The random password can be much more effective overall because it typically forces users to approach passwords differently – often using a different password for each different user. Now that is better security because it stops other accounts that use the same password from being compromised. And, if you are already using random passwords that you can't possibly remember, then why not use longer versions? What do you care?

Conclusion: use pronounceable if you want to remember the password; random otherwise. But make sure it's not too short (less than, say, 10 digits).
