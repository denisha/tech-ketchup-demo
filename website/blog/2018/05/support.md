## Who /What /How and Why Change Advisory Board (CAB)? ##


### Definitions ###

<b>Request for Change's (RFC's) -</b> is a document containing a call for an adjustment of a system; it is of great importance in the change management process. A change request is declarative, i.e. it states what needs to be accomplished, but leaves out how the change should be carried out.<br />
<b>Post Implementation Reviews (PIRs) -</b> is conducted after completing a project. Its purpose is to evaluate whether project objectives were met, to determine how effectively the project was run, to learn lessons for the future, and to ensure that the organization gets the greatest possible benefit from the project.<br />
<b>Emergency CAB (ECAB) -</b> A streamlined version of the Change Advisory Board (CAB) designed to handle emergency changes that are submitted. The ECAB must act quickly on emergency changes and may not have time to fully assess the impact of an emergency change.<br />
<b>Change Management Policy -</b> is the process of requesting, analysing, approving, developing, implementing, and reviewing a planned or unplanned change within the IT infrastructure.<br />

## Why do we need the CAB? ##

The Change Management process must have an owner, he/she is called the Change Manager, this role can be combined with other non-conflicting roles: Service Manager is a good example. The Change Manager can efficiently handle preapproved and smaller standard changes, no sweat. But, when it comes to assessing, prioritizing, authorizing and scheduling of complex changes with higher impact and risks, a group of competent people is needed. They will attend periodically scheduled meetings, address the proposed changes and review the resolved changes.

## Who are the CAB members? ##

Membership of the CAB can vary with the change complexity, impacted business processes and technology. There are usually a few permanent members, with the Change Manager being the first of them. The next one is the Configuration Manager, the person who knows everything about infrastructure. Others can vary: all IT people competent in the impacted service technology, business representative, vendor representative providing underpinning support to the service, etc. <br />
Other usual suspects who can help include:<br />

* Service Desk Manager or Analyst
* Operation Manager
* Application Manager
* Information Security Officer
* Batman (If you can get him, no need to read further.)
	  
In case of an emergency change, a CAB subgroup called the Emergency CAB (ECAB) will be in charge. <br />

### Responsibilities of the CAB ###

* Reviews and approves all high and critical impact Request for Change's (RFC's).
* Ensures that Request for Change (RFC) requestors, initiators, and CRB have proper training regarding the change management process.
* Updates the change management process as needed.
* Ensures Post Implementation Reviews (PIRs) are performed when required and properly documented.
* If necessary, the CAB will recommend communication with the affected Departments/Clients.

## How does the CAB operate? ##

Well, during day-to-day service management the CAB meetings will be scheduled and chaired periodically by the Change Manager, this is typically done weekly. 
During the CAB meetings, a typical agenda will look like this:<br />
* Review the minutes from the last meeting
    * Review changes implemented during the previous period
		* Failed changes
		* Backed-out changes
		* Successful changes
		* Incidents resulting from implemented changes
	* Review/assessment of proposed Requests For Change (RFCs) 
		* Risk and impact in terms of:
			* Service and Service Level impact
			* Capacity and performance
			* Security and compliance
			* Financial	
			* Etc.
		* Resources involved
		* Requests For Change (RFCs) prioritization

It is always a good idea to keep a template in the template database / project portal  that defines the CAB meeting agenda/meeting minutes.

## Conclusion

In case it was not clear from the above, CAB members attend the meetings, and provide advice to the Change Manager. The decision is always up to the Change Manager. Too often I hear the misunderstanding of the CAB acronym as Change *APPROVAL* Board, as opposed to its actual title of Change *ADVISORY* Board. <br/>The Change Manager is responsible for the change approval, based on all the ADVICE provided by the CAB. Thatâ€™s why the appointment of the members is so important and I feel it should be defined in the Change Management Policy. 
<br/>If you choose a less-than-competent business representative, the meetings will drag along, waiting for approval by his/her superior. On the other hand, if you choose a person too high in the hierarchy ladder, he/she might often be unavailable for the meeting due to more important things he/she must attend. The same goes for the technology representative.
