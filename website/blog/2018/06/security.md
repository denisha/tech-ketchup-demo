## Penetration Testing the TappLock

Pen Test Partners recently picked up on a video by a guy breaking the $100 Tapplock. [They set about breaking down and exploiting all the security flaws](https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/totally-pwning-the-tapplock-smart-lock/) in this security-centric product. The read is insightful since it gives us a good idea of how the design process for this product might have happened - poor decisions probably as a result of cost/benefit or some other compromises.
