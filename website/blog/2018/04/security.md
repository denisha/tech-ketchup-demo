## WebAuthn has been promoted, being implemented

The new passwordless standard [is almost finalized now](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/04/practical-passwordless-authentication-comes-a-step-closer-with-webauthn/). If you don't have a Yubi-key or other type of hardware authentication for your most important online assets, seriously consider it. It's the best 2FA mechanism currently available. This new standard however will make it the primary authentication mechanism. Here's hoping that it will seamlessly work with older hardware devices.
