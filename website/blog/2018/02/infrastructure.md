# Infrastructure
I would just like to remind everyone to please use the [ServiceDesk] (http://servicedesk/) to log all IT and Project releated requests.

Also remember to use your OneDrive for Business to store all important work related documents. It is part of your Office365 package and has a massive 4TB's of storage. But most importantly your files are backed up with version control.

If you want more info on this, or help setting it up, please come and speak with us.

## IaaS, PaaS and SaaS
There are many acronyms in computing, and in the cloud none are more important than infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and software-as-a-service (SaaS). These are the building blocks of modern computing.

But what are the differences? Here is a break down all three for you

### IaaS
Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) is the simplest of the three categories to define, as it is broadly the same regardless of which vendor you choose. Simply put, IaaS is where a third party provides highly automated and scalable IT infrastructure - storage, hosting, compute, networking - and only charges for what you use.

So rather than owning assets like software licences or servers, companies can flexibly rent resources according to their needs.
The big players in this market are AWS, Microsoft, Google and IBM. With AWS having a 40% market share, with the other three grouped together at 23 percent combined.

### PaaS
Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) is possibly the hardest of the three cloud models to cleanly define. The idea is to provide all of the basics of IaaS, as well as the tools and capabilities needed to develop and deploy applications securely. That could be middleware, database management, analytics or an operating system.

A platform-as-a-service should provide a developer with everything they need to build and deploy an application without having to do any provisioning of the underlying infrastructure themselves.

PaaS vendors tend to be the biggest technology companies, who can offer a broad range of capabilities for their customers on a platform. Examples include Google App Engine, Oracle Cloud Platform, AWS and Salesforce.
The underlying infrastructure for different PaaS offerings varies, so Oracle and AWS would prefer you run on their own infrastructure, and others are non specific. For example the SAP Cloud Platform can be run on top of AWS, Azure or GCP cloud infrastructure.

### SaaS
Software-as-a-service (SaaS) is where a piece of software is hosted by a third party and can be accessed over the web, normally just by logging in, and is generally charged on a subscription basis per user or 'seat'. This differs from the old model of buying and installing software on a machine or server manually.

SaaS is much more relevant for very specific applications, like email or customer relationship management (CRM) software. Anyone who has used a Google app like Gmail or Google Docs, or cloud file storage like Dropbox, will have used a piece of SaaS.
Major SaaS vendors include Microsoft since it moved Office to the web-based Office 365, as well as enterprise software pioneers like Salesforce with its SaaS CRM solution.
