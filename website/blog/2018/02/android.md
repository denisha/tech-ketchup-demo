# Android
Android powers hundreds of millions of mobile devices in more than 190 countries around the world.  
It's the largest installed base of any mobile platform and growing fast—every day another million users power up their Android devices for the first time and start looking for apps, games, and other digital content.

## Android @ GK
Our small but strong Android team develops, maintains and supports a handful of Global Kinetic projects.  
Within these projects we apply the best practices and research the best, most logical tech stacks available for Android.  
ie. 
- [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) / [RxAndroid](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid) : RxJava is a Java VM implementation of ReactiveX (Reactive Extensions): a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences.
- [Dagger2](https://google.github.io/dagger/) : Dagger is a fully static, compile-time dependency injection framework for both Java and Android. It is developed by the Java Core Libraries Team at Google.
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) : Kotlin is a statically-typed programming language that runs on the Java virtual machine.
- [Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/) : Binary repository manager; this is quite common with Java projects.
- [Gerrit](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/) : A free, web-based team code collaboration tool. Software developers in a team can review each other's modifications on their source code using a Web browser and approve or reject those changes.

Our current short term goal is to integrate all our Android projects' CI builds into [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/)  
SonarQube is an open source platform for continuous inspection of code quality to perform automatic reviews with static analysis of code to detect bugs, code smells and security vulnerabilities on 20+ programming languages including Java and Android.

## What's New
- New features on [Android 8.0 (Oreo)](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/android-8.0.html)
- [Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/index.html) is now an official language on Android. It's expressive, concise, and powerful. Best of all, it's interoperable with our existing Android languages and runtime.  
Will Kotlin replace Java for native Android development? Definitely maybe.

## Security
- [Fake Whatsapp](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/whatsapp-app-android-messaging-apps-fake-google-play-a8039806.html) on the Play Store downloaded by over a million users.
