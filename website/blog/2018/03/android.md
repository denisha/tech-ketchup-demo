# Android
- After over a month of agony and FUD, Tinashe finally received his [Pixel](https://www.gsmarena.com/google_pixel_2_xl-8720.php).  
  He ended up building [this awesome weather app](https://github.com/TinasheMzondiwa/WeatherApp) out of frustration.  
  Tech used :
  - [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
  - [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/)
  - [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html)
  - [Dagger](https://google.github.io/dagger/)
  - [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android)
  
This is actually based on our Android Prac Test Interview.  
Thanks Tinashe! You've raised the bar for our future candidates :D
