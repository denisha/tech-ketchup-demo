## From Mark

The team reminded me that I should be writing a short piece for our newsletter (thanks Henk!).

In the Tech Lead space there are some really exciting things happening.
We have Capitec as a new client where the Tech Leads are working on Sprint 0.
The Capitec team will be building a Remote Onboarding Service which is a part of a bigger vision within the Capitec landscape. All I can really say for now.

The Tech Lead team has completed a DevOps review of all projects within GK and they are creating the stories on our TFS board so that we can track the progress. Once this has been completed the tech leads will be in touch with the various project teams. As a project team you will need to decide how to tackle some of the DevOps tasks on your respective projects.

In the last newsletter Denisha described the application that the QA peeps are building which will assist them in tracking the QA devices. I'd like to extend a request to all the devs in the company to please assist the QA team where possible. Be it code reviews or even assisting in building a module they require.

For those of you that don't know Denisha, here is a short bio:

#### QA Tech Lead

Originally from sunny Durbs, I moved to Cape Town in 2009. (almost 10 years, so I think I can start calling myself a Capetonian)

I have been working in Software Quality Assurance field since 2008 with experience across the insurance, retail and e-commerce sectors.
My career in software testing was unexpected as I stumbled upon this job opportunity.
During this time I realised that finding bugs fuelled my curiosity to learn more in the QA space and as a result this led me to becoming an automation engineer.
Apart from testing, I have been involved in a few start-up pitch competitions as I enjoy coming up with tech solutions that help address the most pressing social problems.

In my spare time, if I am not socialising, I listen to science/tech podcasts and catch up on series.
