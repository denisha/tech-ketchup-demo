## Can .NET Core 2.1 retroactively support .NET Standard 2.1

The .NET team learnt some lessons with the update of .NET Framework 4.6.1 trying to retroactively support .NET Standard 2.0. It did not go well, and they [are taking this to heart](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/860#issuecomment-417742096) now in their considerations for .NET Core 2.1 with the upcoming .NET Standard 2.1

This means that you will have to update to .NET Core 3.0 if there are new APIs in the .NET Standard that you want to use. It now becomes utterly crucial to understand [the difference between .NET Core and .NET Standard](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt842506.aspx). Here is also [a very good answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42939454/what-is-the-difference-between-net-core-and-net-standard-class-library-project).

## .NET Memory Management

Here is a low level overview of the .NET ecosystem and it's memory management:

A big version (and the related book) is [available here](https://prodotnetmemory.com/).

## Fun and horror with ternary

Found this on the internet, which was interesting and very scary:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yesterday my prof said you could use a ternary expression as the LHS of an assignment in C++. I was super skeptical. I was wrong ðŸ˜… why this<br><br>yes this is what you think it is <a href="https://t.co/w2bFJbIBKd">pic.twitter.com/w2bFJbIBKd</a></p>&mdash; mastodon.social/@emilyhorsman (@emilymhorsman) <a href="https://twitter.com/emilymhorsman/status/1037499651925127168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 6, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

From the tweet thread, it is also possible in C#:

```c

int x = 2;
int a = 0;
int b = 0;
((x == 2) ? ref a : ref b) = 42;

```

Or in more verbose, explicit terms:

```c

int x = 2;
int a = 0;
int b = 0;
ref int d = ref ((x == 2) ? ref a : ref b);
d = 42;

```

This is the equivalent of writing:

```c

int x = 2;
int a = 0;
int b = 0;

if (x == 2)
{
  a = 42;
}
else
{
  b = 42;
}

```

So what's going on here? The explicit snippet explains clearly, which is why it is preferred. The variable `d` _points to_ either `a` or `b`, through using `ref`. That is what the purpose of `out` or `ref` is. Then, when assigning a value to `d`, it is effectively being assigned to either `a` or `b`, depending. To illustrate this, in LINQPad write

```c

a.Dump();   //or System.Console.WriteLine($"a:{a}");
b.Dump();
d.Dump();

```

and you'll see that `d` _always_ has the value `42`, because it simply points to wherever the assigned value ended up, but either `a` or `b` has the value depending on `x`.

So where's the horror? Behold:

```c

int x = 2;
int a = 0;
int b = 0;
int.TryParse("42", out ((x == 2) ? ref a : ref b));

```

Please don't do this.
